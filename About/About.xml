  <description>1.21.0.1 (03-07-2020)

While the lingering fear of Cthulhu is most unnerving, you are not alone. The Agency and coastal fishing villages have appeared in the overworld.

	The detectives from The Agency dress themselves with proper detective gear including bowler caps, fedoras, shirts with ties, and trench coats.

	Citizens from the coastal fishing villages wear occupational attire including: police uniforms with caps, farmer overalls and straw hats, raincoats and slicker hats, and nurse uniforms with caps.

	A strange incident has also stranded a mysterious infantry unit from a long lost great war on your world.

	Top hats, newsboy caps, are also now included.

	Finally, a special branch of the Agency used to root out monstrous forces can be seen wearing lighter special forces gear. They are called M.E.R.F. (Mobile Eldritch Response Force), and they come equipped with combat armor and helmets (light and heavy variants).

	Have fun!
